					<p><span class="first-letter">P</span>roject Hope is an NGO providing medical relief and health services to disaster areas, they are a world wide organization who has trained over 2 million health workers over the course of 60 years. The goal of this project was to provide the client with a new, modern, responsive website to better represent Project Hope’s new branding. At Forum One, we decided the best solution was to provide them with a new wordpress website, tailored to their organization’s needs. That included a new and slick user interface, a colorful and eye catching design that still maintains a sense of gravity and importance. We wanted to place weight and significance to their imagery, which is why we assigned large, high-res featured images to their main curated content.</p>
					<p>The site was developed with a “mobile first” approach. It’s designed to enhance gracefully over screen sizes and deliver to users the same experienced regardless of the device on which the website is accessed.
					</p>
					<p>At Forum One, we base all our website off a universal, mobile first, responsive theme, developed to work both in Drupal and Wordpress. Our theme, “Gesso”, is customized and modify to suit the projects need first on our local environment, and is then implemented onto the our CMS of choice. To facilitate our workflow, Gesso is implemented with Twig, a php templating language used to build custom pages and websites for Drupal (primarily) and Wordpress. Following the pattern design principles to establish our workflow. <span class="text-large">Upon receiving the approved design, I broke down each page into <span class="text-large copper">components - the smallest and reusable elements within the design, regions, layouts and pages.</span> To facilitate the process, I also abide to the BEM naming conventions, to make blocks reusable and modular. </span> To build the front end, I first turned the designs into responsive web pages in Pattern Lab, our tool to display and test all front end related builds before they are implemented onto the CMS. By doing so, I can develop and test each component, region, layout and page within a separate and independent environment; address any design changes the client might have requested and spot any issues that need resolved before diving into implementation with the back end.
